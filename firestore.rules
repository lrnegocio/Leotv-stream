/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset implements a hybrid security model for the VideoVerse Player application.
 * It combines role-based access for administrators with a strict user-ownership model for personal data.
 * The primary goal is to allow administrators to manage all public content and user accounts, while users
 * can only read public content and manage their own private data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Private user data, owned by the user but manageable by admins.
 *   - /users/{userId}/{document=**}: Recursive wildcard for all subcollections (like 'sessions'),
 *     ensuring admin has full control for operations like recursive deletes.
 * - /channels/{channelId}: Publicly readable content collection managed exclusively by admins. It contains
 *   nested subcollections for seasons and episodes, also covered by a recursive wildcard.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin Privilege via Email: Admin status is determined by checking if the authenticated user's email is 'admin@example.com'.
 *   This is a direct and secure method for a single-admin system.
 * - Recursive Permissions: The `{document=**}` wildcard is intentionally used to grant broad permissions
 *   to admins for all subcollections. This is critical for allowing admins to perform recursive deletes
 *   (e.g., deleting a user and all their sessions) without permission errors.
 * - Public Content Model: All content under `/channels` is readable by any authenticated user.
 *   All write operations (create, update, delete) on this content are strictly limited to administrators.
