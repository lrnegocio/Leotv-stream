/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset implements a hybrid security model for the VideoVerse Player application.
 * It combines role-based access for administrators with a strict user-ownership model for personal data.
 * The primary goal is to allow administrators to manage all public content and user accounts, while users
 * can only read public content and manage their own private data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Private user data, owned by the user but manageable by admins.
 *   - /users/{userId}/sessions/{sessionId}: Subcollection for user session data, strictly owned by the user but deletable by admins.
 * - /channels/{channelId}: Publicly readable content collection managed exclusively by admins. It contains
 *   nested subcollections for seasons and episodes.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin Privilege via Email: Admin status is determined by checking if the authenticated user's email is 'admin@example.com'.
 *   This is a direct and secure method for a single-admin system.
 * - User Data Privacy vs. Admin Management: Users have limited control over their own data in `/users/{userId}`.
 *   Administrators are granted full `read` and `write` permissions to manage all user accounts, including deletion.
 * - Public Content Model: All content under `/channels` is readable by any authenticated user.
 *   All write operations (create, update, delete) on this content are strictly limited to administrators.
 * - App-Side Blocking Logic: The user `isBlocked` flag is enforced by the application logic during login,
 *   not by complex read rules. This simplifies the ruleset and prevents permission denial cycles.
